# EnergyServices

This repository contains two projects developed for the **Energy Services** course in my MSc in Engineering Physics.

## Repository Structure

- `Project1_ForecastingModel/` – Development of a regression model to predict electricity consumption.
- `Project2_Dashboard/` – Testing the regression model with 2019 data and building a dashboard for visualization and interaction.

Each folder contains code, data (where possible), and documentation related to the respective project.
